<h5><strong>MAKE IT COUNT!</strong></h5>

<p>If you are already partnering with a community agency or organization and are providing service, TELL US ABOUT IT! <strong> Please record your service hours by entering them into your personal or your group or organization&#39;s CatLife account. </strong> <!-- Let us know about the great partnership you have formed with the community! WHY?! We want to be able to celebrate all the amazing ways in which all our students are engaged with the community. --> YOU are making a tremendous impact, and if we can begin to gather an accurate record of all the service you do, we can share and celebrate, and open new doors!</p>

<p>Recording service hours can also be a benefit for your future resume or graduate school application. It also contributes to the year-end total number of service hours contributed by UC Merced students, a number that needs YOUR hours to be more accurate.</p>

<h4><strong>WHICH HOURS DO YOU RECORD IN CATLIFE? </strong></h4>

<div class="side1">
	<p><strong>ONLY COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS ARE TO BE RECORDED IN CATLIFE:</strong></p>

	<p>Direct <strong>community service</strong> is characterized by <strong><em>action</em> </strong>(hands-on service) that meets a community-identified need for the benefit of underserved individuals, groups, or organizations and projects focused on issues that benefit the common good.</p>

	<p>It should help improve the quality of life for community residents and helps to solve public problems, such as tutoring K-12 students, youth development, literacy, education, social services, health and wellness, safety, transportation, crime prevention, recreation, rural development, or neighborhood and community improvement.</p>
	<!-- <p><strong>Example of organization service hours</strong> :</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>tabling or fundraising for your club</li>
  </ul> --></div>

<div class="side2">
	<p><strong>NOT IN CATLIFE</strong> :<strong>&nbsp;Volunteer work on campus that benefits&nbsp;only the on-campus community. </strong></p>

	<p>For example, tabling for your RCO to recruit more members, helping set up for an event only open to the UC Merced campus community, etc.&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Philanthropy/Fundraising</strong> generally refers to activities related to securing donations to benefit and support an organization, group or agency that is dedicated to helping those in need (i.e. St. Jude&rsquo;s, American Cancer Society, Red Cross, etc.). <!-- For example, participating in a walk-a-thon, dance-thon, collecting donations, or selling tickets to raise funds for the Red Cross to aid flood victims, are philanthropic activities. --><br />
		<strong><em><u>PLEASE DO NOT</u></em></strong> <strong> <em> record your philanthropy/fundraising hours and/or your organizational service hours in CatLife as it will invalidate all posted service hours! </em> </strong></p>

	<p>Philanthropy/fundraising and organization service hours must be captured by your organization through other means of your choice.</p>
	<!-- <p><strong>Examples of Philanthropy and fundraising activities</strong> :</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>pancake breakfast to benefit Amnesty International</li>
  	<li>participating in Relay for Life to raise funds for The American Cancer Society</li>
  	<li>setting up tables and chairs for agency fundraising dinner</li>
  </ul> --></div>
