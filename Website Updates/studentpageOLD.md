<p>Welcome to the Community Engagement Center! Through this page, we hope that you will be able to find a community service or engagement opportunity that best fits your interests.</p>

<h3>Partnering with Our Community</h3>

<p>Now that you are a UC Merced Bobcat and a Merced County resident, there are many opportunities to become involved with your new community! Merced is a community of vibrant, resilient, hard-working people who will value the time, energy, and ideas of fellow community members who are willing to come along-side local organizations, agencies, schools etc. to help them meet the populations they serve. Embrace your new community, and enjoy partnering with, and getting to know, those who have lived here for years, and others, like yourself, who may be brand new to this place we call the Central Valley.</p>

<p>For community service and engagement opportunities, please see below and feel free to contact communityservice@ucmerced.edu with any questions!</p>
