Apply Today - Fall 2025 Graduates have a deadline of December 5th to Apply! 
The Public Service & Leadership Certificate (PSL) is an opportunity for active UC Merced students to celebrate their commitment to: public service, academic achievement in community engaged courses, and in community engaged projects.

We hope this opportunity will motivate UC Merced students to not only participate in more community service activities, but also increase their leadership experiences and sense of belonging during their time at UC Merced and beyond.

Upon completing the first step of the process which is the Pathways to Public Service Assessment, students will receive a confirmation email with the links to complete the rest of the requirements. Aside from completing the Pathways to Public Service as the first step, the rest of the requirements do not have to be completed in a specific order. 

If students are accepted as a PSL student, they will be awarded an achievement certificate and a distinct graduation cord to recognize their efforts and service to UC Merced and surrounding communities.

In order to be eligible to apply students must complete and fill out the following surveys:
