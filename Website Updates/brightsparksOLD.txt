<h3><em>About the Program</em></h3>

<p>Bright Spark Scholars is a donor-funded&nbsp;tutoring program that began in Fall 2024. The program&nbsp;helps elementary students succeed in literacy and mathematics.&nbsp;This two-semester program is a partnership between UC Merced&rsquo;s Community Engagement Center and elementary schools within the City of Merced.&nbsp; Tutors receive curriculum training, transportation to the schools, and support to mentor their tutees in the important skills of literacy and numeracy &ndash; skills that help set them up for success later on in their academic, social, and economic lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tutor who completes <strong>60 service</strong> hours during the semester will receive a <strong>$1000 stipend</strong> (up to $2000 per academic year).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the pilot year (2024&ndash;2025), 13 Bright Spark Scholars Tutors worked with K&ndash;3 students at Farmdale Elementary School, providing literacy instruction. Each tutor received transportation to the school for their sessions and averaged 6&ndash;8 hours per week on tutoring, lesson preparation, and training. Thanks to their dedication and hard work, the average reading level of the students they tutored <strong>increased by 1.2 grade levels</strong>!</p>

<p>As we&rsquo;re moving on to our 2nd year, we&rsquo;ve added <strong>mathematics</strong> as a subject matter and are <strong>doubling</strong> the number of tutors and sites we&rsquo;ll be working with.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>For Fall 2025 - Spring 2026, we have a cohort of 30 tutors who will be working with K-5 students at two schools within the Merced City School District.&nbsp;</strong></p>
