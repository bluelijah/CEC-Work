<h3><em>Become a Best You, Best Future Mentor&nbsp;</em></h3>

<p>Are you looking for a service opportunity that will allow you to gain experience working with youth while empowering them? If so, Best You, Best Future (BYBF) is the perfect opportunity for you! The Community Engagement Center has partnered with 4 local school districts: Livingston, Weaver, Merced River &amp; Planada to bring their 6th grade students to UC Merced for a personalized tour, lunch and an empowering workshop! The Campus Visits will take place in&nbsp;March and April during a weekday (Monday - Friday) for two and a half hours, volunteers will be able to select which campus visits they can attend once they have completed the BYBF volunteer training.</p>

<p>We are looking for volunteers who want to make a positive impact in our local youth. Volunteers must attend a training in order to become a BYBF Mentor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By participating in the Best You, Best Future&nbsp;program, you will be eligible for our&nbsp;<strong>Community Service Graduation Pin!</strong>&nbsp;Full participation must be completed for the Community Service Graduation Pin, which is a semester-long commitment.</p>
