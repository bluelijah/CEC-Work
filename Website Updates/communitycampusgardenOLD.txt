<h2><b>Campus Garden - Fall 2025 Hours</b></h2>

<p>The UC Merced Campus Garden is dedicated to addressing food insecurity by providing students with access to fresh, locally grown produce. The garden offers a variety of items, including tea leaves, cooking herbs, fruits, and vegetables. These items support the Food Bank at Basic Needs, helping to alleviate food insecurity on campus. In addition to its role in food distribution, the garden also offers valuable volunteer opportunities for students to get involved.</p>
